Q1: Why might be consider using git?

Answer: We consider using Git because it provides a powerful version control system 
that helps manage changes in a project’s codebase over time. Git allows developers 
to track and record every modification, which is essential for reverting to previous 
versions if mistakes are made. It also facilitates collaboration by enabling multiple 
developers to work on the same project simultaneously without overwriting each other’s 
changes, using branches to isolate and later merge updates. Additionally, Git ensures 
that a full project history is stored, providing a safety net against data loss and 
making it easier to identify and resolve conflicts. It also supports distributed 
workflows, allowing teams to work remotely and asynchronously while maintaining a 
unified codebase.
