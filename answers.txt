Q1: Why might be consider using git?

Answer: We consider using Git because it provides a powerful version control system 
that helps manage changes in a project’s codebase over time. Git allows developers 
to track and record every modification, which is essential for reverting to previous 
versions if mistakes are made. It also facilitates collaboration by enabling multiple 
developers to work on the same project simultaneously without overwriting each other’s 
changes, using branches to isolate and later merge updates. Additionally, Git ensures 
that a full project history is stored, providing a safety net against data loss and 
making it easier to identify and resolve conflicts. It also supports distributed 
workflows, allowing teams to work remotely and asynchronously while maintaining a 
unified codebase.

Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give and Example and how it might help

Answer: Data science can be applied to many fields, such as healthcare. For example, in 
medical diagnosis, data science can analyze large datasets from patient records, lab 
results, and imaging data to help identify patterns and predict health outcomes. Machine 
learning algorithms can assist doctors in diagnosing diseases earlier, recommending 
personalized treatment plans, and improving patient care by detecting anomalies that 
might not be visible to the human eye. This leads to more accurate diagnoses, efficient 
treatments, and better overall healthcare outcomes.


Q3: What is the difference between merging and rebasing?

Answer: Merging combines two branches by creating a new merge commit, preserving the full 
history of both branches, including where they diverged. This keeps the project’s development 
timeline intact but can result in a more complex history. Rebasing, in contrast, rewrites the 
commit history by applying your branch’s changes on top of another branch, creating a linear 
history without merge commits. This makes the history cleaner, but it can be risky when working 
in teams because it alters commit history.

Q4: What skills do you hope to improve during this course?

Answer: During this course, I hope to improve my skills in Pandas and machine learning. I want to 
enhance my ability to use Pandas for efficient data manipulation and cleaning, preparing real-world 
datasets for analysis. In machine learning, I plan to deepen my understanding of building, tuning, 
and evaluating models for tasks like classification. I would love to learn more about neural networks
and how they work.
