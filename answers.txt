Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give and Example and how it might help

Answer: Data science can be applied to many fields, such as healthcare. For example, in 
medical diagnosis, data science can analyze large datasets from patient records, lab 
results, and imaging data to help identify patterns and predict health outcomes. Machine 
learning algorithms can assist doctors in diagnosing diseases earlier, recommending 
personalized treatment plans, and improving patient care by detecting anomalies that 
might not be visible to the human eye. This leads to more accurate diagnoses, efficient 
treatments, and better overall healthcare outcomes.
